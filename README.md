Introduction

Welcome to the AES Encryption and Decryption project! This project implements the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm from scratch using Python. AES is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm capable of encrypting and decrypting data securely. In this project, you can encrypt a given text by generating a random encryption key. Similarly, you can decrypt a cipher text using the corresponding key to retrieve the original text. This implementation does not rely on any ready-made libraries, providing you with a deeper understanding of the AES algorithm. Let's explore the key features and usage of this AES encryption and decryption implementation.
